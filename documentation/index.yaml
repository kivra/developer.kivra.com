    This document is intended for developers and others who are interested in integrating with [Kivra](https://www.kivra.com) to send digital mail. Questions can be sent to [dev@kivra.com](mailto:dev@kivra.com).

    If anything is missing or seems incorrect, please check the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kivra/developer.kivra.com/issues) for existing known issues or [create a new issue](https://github.com/kivra/developer.kivra.com/issues/new).

    ### Introduction
    The Kivra API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable,
    resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors.

    Integration in its simplest form consists of two steps:

      1. The first step is to synchronize the Recipient-databases either as a whole or one by one and see which Recipients the tenant can send contents to
      2. The second step is to send the contents itself.

    There are also optional steps that explain additional services Kivra provides. Currently these additional integrations exist:

    ### Inactive Content
    For tenants wishing to send content to Recipients who are at the time not existing in Kivra’s database. Kivra will then store the content for the agreed period of time and deliver it once/if the target Recipient registers with Kivra within this period of time.

    <aside class="notice">
    Note: Usage of inactive content is only allowed in certain specific cases and its usage needs to be regulated in the business relationship between the sender party and Kivra.
    </aside>

    ## The service
    Kivra is a secure digital mailbox tied to your social security number or
    VAT-number to which you receive documents from companies, organizations
    and government agencies that are connected to Kivra. With Kivra you can
    receive, manage and archive your content wherever you are and on every
    platform as long as you have an internet connection.

    Over one billion window envelopes are sent every year in Sweden alone, so
    by choosing to use Kivra you contribute to a reduced carbon footprint!

    Kivra acts as a digital postman between Sender and Recipients which is
    also reflected in the allocation of responsibilities. Concretely, this
    means that the Sender is responsible for the design and content whereas
    Recipients are responsible for reading and processing the received content.

    # Terminology
    ### User
    An end user who is a user of Kivra and receives Content from tenants. A user is a physical person. A user can become `dormant` or deactivate themselves and be put under a `grace period`. Both these states is to aid the Tenant in making sure that only active Users are available for receiving Content. See below for more information on Dormant and Grace period.

    ### Company
    A Company is a judicial person that can receive content from tenants. Users that are signatories to the company have access to the company’s mailbox and archive. Other Users that are not signatories may also be given access to a company’s mailbox and archive. A Company can become `dormant` or deactivated by users that are signatories to the company. Both these states is to aid the Tenant in making sure that only active Companies are available for receiving Content. See below for more information on Dormant and Grace period.

    ### Recipient
    A Company or a User in the context of being a receiver. Throughout this document Recipient is used to interchangeably mean a User or Company being a receiver.

    ### Tenant / Integrator
    Tenant is a sender that is integrated with Kivra. They need not be integrated directly, but can go through an integrator. The integrator acts as intermediary for the tenant at integration and can handle multiple tenants.
    
    ### Partner
    Partner is a third-party company (typically an ERP company) that may be granted access to access and process a company's mailbox, on behalf of the company.

    ### Content
    The information sent by Tenants to Recipients, i.e. Documents, Invoices, etc.

    ### Dormant Recipient
    Recipient who can’t be reached by email and sms-notifications are put in a "dormant"-state. During this dormant state the Recipient won’t show up in any of user or company files but the Tenant can still send Content which the Recipient will receive. When a Recipient log-in again they are awaken from dormant state and will start appearing in user files again.

    ### Grace period
    Kivra employs a 45 day grace period when a Recipient deactivates. During this grace period the Recipient won’t show up in any of user or company files and the Tenant can still send Content which the Recipient will receive.

    ### User object
    is a data object that contains all the available information about a user

    ### Company object
    is a data object that contains all the available information about a company

    ### Tenant object
    is a data object that contains all the available information about a sender.

    ### Content object
    is a data object that contains information about the document and the document itself

    ### Tenant key
    Is a unique key that identifies a Tenant. The tenant key is not related to the VAT identifier and as such can be used to address a specific Tenant when a Sender might wish to setup multiple Tenants for one VAT identifier.

    ### Metadata
    is data about data or information about data. Originally, the concept of meta-information, ie information about information. Normally metadata or metadata to describe the content and / or structure for a given data collection from any perspective. Kivra uses metadata to determine whom a consignment is to and other information that may be relevant for a shipment. as such payment information.

    ### Json
    Json or JavaScript Object Notation is a structured approach to data management. Similar to XML but much simpler and easier to read. JSON is the default serialization format  within the Kivra system. JSON have a limited set of types and close attention needs to be paid to the correct JSON-type for metadata when sending Content to Kivra.

    # Conventions
    ## Date & Time
    KIVRA encodes and decodes all dates and times as [ISO 8601](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) values. The format looks like YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD, example 1970-01-01T23:25:10.0330000+01:00 where:

    * YYYY, The year including century
    * MM, Month
    * DD, Day
    * T, Separator
    * hh, Zero-padded hour between 00 and 24 (where 24 is only used to notate midnight at the end of a calendar day)
    * mm, Zero-padded minutes between 00 and 59
    * ss, Zero-padded second between 00 and 60 (where 60 is only used to notate an added leap second)
    * s, one or more digits representing a decimal fraction of a second
    * TZD, Time zone designator (Z or +hh:mm or -hh:mm)

    ## UTC
    If the time is in UTC, add a 'Z' directly after the time without a space. 'Z' is the zone designator for the zero UTC offset. "09:30 UTC" is therefore represented as "09:30Z" or "0930Z". "14:45:15 UTC" would be "14:45:15Z" or "144515Z". UTC time is also known as 'Zulu' time, since 'Zulu' is the NATO phonetic alphabet word for 'Z'.

    The offset from UTC is given in the format ±[hh]:[mm], ±[hh][mm], or ±[hh]. So if the time being described is one hour ahead of UTC (such as the time in Stockholm during the winter), the zone designator would be "+01:00", "+0100", or simply "+01". This is appended to the time in the same way that 'Z' was above. The offset from UTC changes with daylight saving time, e.g. a time offset in Chicago, would be "-06:00" for the winter (Central Standard Time) and "-05:00" for the summer (Central Daylight Time).

    ## Media types
    The [Iana](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) Media type, e.g. "application/pdf"

    ## UTF-8 encoding
    All data sent to Kivra needs to be [UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoded.

    ## Currency
    All places where currency is specified [ISO4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) should be used.

    ## Country code
    Where applicable KIVRA uses a country code to determine certain formats. The country code should always be supplied using the [ISO 3166-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) alpha-2 two-letter code.

    ## Email address
    Email addresses needs to be specified using [E.123](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.123)

    ## Phone numbers (mobile, land line)
    All phone numbers needs to be specified using [E.123](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.123)

    ## Identifying users
    Kivra uses the social security number/personal-number as key when accepting content. The format must adhere to the format "YYYYMMDDnnnn" that is including century-digits, i.e. "191212121212".

    ## VAT identifier
    In many countries, companies (or even individuals) are registered with authorities responsible for collecting taxes derived from the business transactions performed by the companies. That registration commonly yields a registration number, which uniquely identifies that company within the domain of the authority. Some legislation has a concept of VAT grouping, in which case the structure of the VAT identifier may reflect the grouping by e.g. suffixing the number.

    The full identifier starts with an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (except for Greece which uses the non-standard country code EL) and then has between 2 and 12 characters. The identifiers are composed of numeric digits in most countries, but in some countries they may contain letters. For instance, Kivra’s VAT Id would be: SE556840226601.

    # Limits
    Kivra handles millions of documents. We put limits to protect the system from receiving more data than it can handle, and to ensure an equitable distribution of system resources. There’s also various practical reasons for this, such as reducing Head-of-line blocking and providing a optimal experience for the enduser.

    Our policies are as follows and are subject to change.

    ## Content File-size
    1 MB per **Content** per **Recipient**. This is the total JSON-object. For example, if you send two PDF’s embedded in a JSON-Content to a User the total for the JSON have to have a size less than 1 MB.
    
    ## Rate limit
    20 **contents** to the same **recipient** per minute. You can send many more contents per minute as long as they are to different receivers, but only up to 20 to the same recipient.

    # Interacting with the API
    All API access is performed over HTTPS through [api, sandbox].kivra.com and data is sent and received as [JSON](http://www.json.org/). For trying out the API without touching live data we’ve set up a sandbox, reachable through sandbox.kivra.com.
    In order to ensure data privacy the following choices have been made, to name some that directly impact API workflows:
    Unencrypted HTTP is not supported, you will be redirected to the resource you tried to reach, with http replaced by https, if you attempt to use plain HTTP.
    Resources you have no right to see will either give you a describing status code or a 404. 404 statuses are returned if the case is such that you don’t even have the right to know, according to the system's current state, if an object exists.

    ## API Endpoints
    Kivra uses different endpoints for production and testing described below. We also provide the current IP addresses that *could* serve API requests, the current DNS-record will provide an up-to-date list with active endpoints. This is not meant to be a complete list of Kivra-maintained IP addresses. Please make sure to **always** access the Kivra API using the correct domain-name and environment instead of relying on IP addresses.

    Kivra maintains a infrastructure, which grows dynamically to accommodate increasing demand. As a result, Kivra API servers use a range of IP addresses, and the addresses often change.

    *Please note that we do not recommend managing firewall restrictions by IP address, as the IPs associated with these domains are not static.*

    <aside class="notice">
    All interaction with Kivra's APIs must be done over HTTPS.
    </aside>

    ### Production environment
    The API endpoint for the production environment can be found at

    `https://api.kivra.com`

    IP adresses that may host the API endpoint:

    * 5.178.78.52
    * 5.178.78.53
    * 46.21.99.50
    * 46.21.99.51

    <aside class="notice">
    This is the live production environment, for testing, please use Sandbox.
    </aside>

    ### Sandbox environment
    The API for the sandbox environment can be found at

    `https://sandbox.kivra.com`

    IP adresses that may host the Sandbox endpoint:

    * 104.199.61.8

    <aside class="warning">
    This is not to be used with any critical or production data. We make no guarantees as to the availability of the service, or the data stored by it.
    </aside>

    *We usually deploy the latest production environment to our Sandbox, but may occasionally update it with newer builds, which may not be as reliable or well tested.*

    ## URL Components
    When constructing resource identifiers (URIs) it is best to consider them as being built with up to four discrete units.

    ### Endpoint
    `https://TYPE.kivra.com/VERSION`

    ### Tenant resource
    `/tenant/TENANTKEY`

    ### Parameters
    `/?QUERYSTRING`

    ## Unit Fields
    The units have parameterized fields, which allow you to change their respective meanings, those fields are briefly described below.

    ### TYPE
    `sandbox` for development and test or `api` for production purposes.

    ### VERSION
    Current and only API version is `v1.`

    ### KEY
    The identifier of an object in a collection, its ID, if you will.

    ### QUERYSTRING
    A set of key-value pairs, used for filtering and setting options on collections.

    ## HTTP Verbs
    Where possible, the KIVRA API strives to use appropriate HTTP verbs for each action. The terms verb and method are used interchangingly.

    ### Idempotency
    The API supports idempotency for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. For example, if a request that is idempotent fails due to a network connection error, you can safely retry the request.

    `GET` and `DELETE` requests are idempotent by definition, meaning that the same backend work will occur no matter how many times the same request is issued. You shouldn't send an idempotency key with these verbs because it will have no effect.

    In short, this means that making a request with an idempotent verb only changes the state of the data the first time the request is made.

    ## Methods
    Read more about [HTTP/1.1 Method Definitions](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html).

    | Method      | Details                                                    |
    | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
    | GET         | Used to read a resource, be it a collection or an object. That is, it can be performed repeatedly without changing the state of the resource |
    | POST        | Used for creating resources, or performing custom or batch type actions |
    | PUT         | Used for updating resources or collections, but can also be used to create a resource when the key has been predetermined. Note that `PUT` apply to the entire resource and not just parts of it. So, when doing a `PUT` operation, the entire resource is replaced |
    | DELETE      | Used for deleting resources. Delete is atomic and acts on the whole resource, that is it can not be used to delete a part or alter the state of a resource. Use `PUT` for that |

    # Resource Types
    There are two main types of resources – objects and collections of objects, they are individually outlined in the following sections.
    It can generally be said that if a URL ends with a unique identifier (also known as a key), it is an object or a sub-object. Resources ending with collection names are collection resources.

    ## Object Resources
    Objects are mostly real-world things, such as a user, tenant to name a few, but they can also be abstract things, like a sendrequest.

    An example: */v1/tenant/13443459078e31ba8630e2e9842906c7baf38b131e*

    ### Allowed Methods
    **GET**
    Read the representation of an object as it is accessible and viewable by you.

    **PUT**
    Update the object. If the object doesn’t already exist, it is created.

    **PATCH**
    Update the object with the specified attributes. If the object doesn’t already exist, it is created.

    **DELETE**
    Irreversably delete the designated resource from the entire system. This operation will in most cases be illegal for regular API consumers.

    ## Collection Resources
    Collections are conceptually lists of objects, that can be queried. Queries without any parameters will cause a listing of the keys that are used to identify the objects within the collection; adding parameters will either filter which keys show up or decorate the keys with the object they identify (in part or entirely).

    When a collection resource is queried it will only return the list of keys that identify the objects it contains. If you want to see the actual objects you have to append the query parameter include=body to the URI, more on this below.

    An example: */v1/tenant*

    ### Allowed Methods
    **GET**
    List objects under the Collection, either all or using filters to search.

    **POST**
    Create a new object under the Collection.

    ## Filters and Flags
    In order to facilitate filtering/searching amongst the API objects, we provide the possibility to pass certain query string parameters that indicate which objects to include in the response and how they should be treated.

    ### Filters
    When searching for an object, it is suggested that you list the appropriate collection and add query parameters for the features of the object(s) you are trying to find in the URI. For example, when looking for if a user exists and is addressable for this Tenant, the resulting URL would be as follows `/tenant/TKEY/user/?ssn=SSN`

    ### Flags
    As mentioned, collections only list the keys of their member objects, which might inconvenience you by forcing you to make individual GET requests for each key in the list. In order to not waste bandwidth or time from setup and teardown of connections we supply the include flag. The include parameter currently accepts one of two values, body and fields, which indicate that you want the entire object or that you want a specific subset of the available fields, respectively.

    **Note:** When the include parameter is set to fields it is assumed that you will also pass a fields parameter with a comma-separated list of names, declaring which fields you want to view.

    # Tenants integration
    Tenants integration allows *tenants* and *integrators* to send *content* to *recipents* via Kivra.
    
    Tenants and integrator will use the `tenant` endpoint to integrate with Kivra.
    
    ## Opt-out
    Kivra uses a method called opt-out to make the service as easy as possible for Recipients and Senders. Opt-out means that when a Recipient register with Kivra they’ll automatically receive documents from all Tenants connected to Kivra. Recipients do not need to enable individual Tenants to start receiving Content.

    ### Meaning of Opt-out for:
    #### Tenant
    Can start sending Content to all Recipients in Kivra
    When Tenant signs up new customers they can match that customers SSN or VAT-number to the user- or companies_accept-file respectively and start sending Content directly.
    A Recipient can choose to disable a Tenant. In that case, that user or company will no longer show up in the Tenant’s user- or companies_accept-file respectively and a 45-day grace period will take effect. During this grace period the Tenant can still post Content.

    #### Recipients
    Recipients will automatically start receiving Content from new Tenants
    Recipients can choose to disable a Tenant. In that case, that Recipient will no longer show up in the Tenant’s  user- or companies_accept-file respectively and a 45-day grace period will take effect. During this grace period the Tenant can still post Content.

    ## Step 1: Synchronize Recipients
    The first thing in every integration is to synchronize which Recipients can receive Content from the Tenant. Trying to send Content to Recipients not found when synchronizing will be automatically denied unless that Recipient is in a 45 days’ grace period with that Tenant.

    This means that for each Tenant the Recipient-request is unique and therefore integrators integrating many Tenants need to keep track of the different Recipients for each of the separate Tenants.

    Synchronization of Recipients is done via the `user` and `usermatch` resources.

    ## Step 2: Send Content
    Metadata is data that Kivra needs to send the Content to the right Recipient. It may also determine how a Recipient can interact with the Content.

    Sending of Content is done via the `content` resource.

    ## Typical integration flows
    The Kivra API is typically integrated in different data flows, resulting in many different scenarios. In this paragraph we will describe few of these typical scenarios and provide some tips on how to use the API in that context.
    
    ### Daily document sending
    In this scenario the sender needs to send a large amount of documents each day, some of which is sent via Kivra, the rest via ordinary post. There is therefore need for knowing very early in the process whether a document can be sent via Kivra or needs to be printed and sent by ordinary post.
    
    The sender uses the API to synchronize the recipient database, typically during the night, and use the recipient database to select which documents to be sent via Kivra and which need to be printed and sent via ordinary post.
    
    Even if the recipient database have been synchronized, it is still important to check the result of the API operation when sending content, as some recipient might have become unavailable in the time between the synchronization of the recipient database and the sending of the document. In this case the API will answer with an error code (typically 40105). The documents that could not be sent via API will need to be sent via ordinary post, typically as part of tomorrow's batch.
    
    ### Payslips and retain functionality
    Payslips are typically small batches of documents sent once a month that can be handled using a simpler flow, not including the matching step but using the retain functionality instead.
    
    In this approach the sender sends all documents without checking if the user is a Kivra user or not, relying on the retain functionality instead. Content sent to non-Kivra users will be retained for a period of time (typically 390 days for payslips), meaning that it is kept by Kivra but not delivered. If the user creates a Kivra account before the retention period expires, the user will get all retained content. If the user does not create a Kivra account before the retention period expires, the content will be removed from Kivra.
    
    ### Payments and invoices
    Kivra allows to send both payable invoices (that might be paid via Kivra applications) or payment notifications that cannot be paid via Kivra, as for instance notification of autogiro payments. 
    
    "payable" is the field in the metadata controlling whether the document should be payable via Kivra applications or not. As Kivra uses the information provided in the metadata to actually perform the payment, it is very important that metadata in the "payment" section is correct.
    
    # Partners integration (BETA)
    Partners integration allows a *company recipient* to open up its mailbox to a third party (a *partner*) to allow it to access and process the mailbox content. This is typically used by companies to allow bookkeeping and administrative third parties to access and process invoices and documents.
    
    Company recipients need to explicitly authorize a partner to access their content via a setting in their Kivra Company mailbox, and they can revoke access at any time. Both granting and revoking of access are performed via the Kivra app.
    
    Partners will use the `partner` endpoint to integrate with Kivra. 
    
    The Partner endpoint is currently in BETA, so changes to the endpoint might occur before the final release 
    
    # Errors
    Kivra uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, invalid data, etc.). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Kivra's servers (these are rare).

    ## Error handling
    The integrator needs proper handling of common errors. Errors can happen at any stage and Kivra will report back to let the integrator take appropriate action.

    ### Recipient-file synchronization:
    Common errors that can occur and need to be handled gracefully.

    * Network problem that hinders the integrator from communicating with Kivra
    * Problem on Kivra’s end that hinders the integrator from querying the state of **Recipients**

    These errors should be handled gracefully such that the last working download of a **Recipient**-file is used until the problem has been solved and a new **Recipient**-file can be downloaded and used.

    ### Content Delivery:
    Common errors that can occur and need to be handled gracefully.

    * Network problem that hinders the integrator from communicating with Kivra resulting in either not being able to reach Kivra or a non-successful response-code
    * Problem with the **input**-file either due to above(network problem) or other such as corrupt data or invalid metadata.

    ## Error Messages
    When the KIVRA API returns error messages, it does so in a extended JSON format.

    > ### Example error response

    ```bash
    { "code"          : 40400
    , "short_message" : "Resource not found"
    , "long_message"  : "There's no resource at the given URI."
    }
    ```

    ### An error has four properties:

    | Property      | Description                                                |
    | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
    | code          | The Kivra [error code](#error-codes)                       |
    | short_message | A short description of the error                           |
    | long_message  | A longer and more verbose error message                    |

    ## Error codes
    In addition to descriptive error text, error messages contain machine-parseable codes. While the text for an error message may change, the codes will stay the same. The following table describes the codes which may appear when working with the API:

    | Code | Short Message | Long Message |
    | ---- | ------------- | ------------ |
    |40000 |Invalid Token |Could not authenticate with OAuth2 using the supplied token |
    |40001 |Invalid Request |The request was invalid |
    |40002 |Redirect URI Mismatch |The redirect_uri does not match the registered redirect_uri |
    |40003 |Email adress in use |The email adress supplied is already in use |
    |40004 |Already registered |This user is already registered |
    |40005 |Error in phonenumber |The request can't be processed due to phonenumber not meeting the required format |
    |40006 |Error in password |The request can't be processed due to password not meeting the required format |
    |40007 |Error in email |The request can't be processed due to email not meeting the required format |
    |40008 |Unprocessable Entity |The JSON payload was malformed. The client should not resend the same payload without first correcting the erroneous JSON payload. |
    |40009 |Error in SSN |The request can't be processed due to SSN not meeting the required format. |

        Metadata is data that Kivra needs to send the Content to the right User. It may also determine how a User can interact with the Content.

        ### Minimum Metadata
        As a minimum a valid `ssn` or `vat_number` is required.

        <aside class="notice">
        Note: Kivra will reject Content using both `ssn` and `vat_number` in the same metadata as this is ambiguous.
        </aside>

        ### Inactive Content
        An inactive Content is a Content that is sent to a Recipient who is not yet a user of Kivra. Once that Recipient register with Kivra, the Content will be delivered to that Recipient’s Kivra account. Inactive Content has a time limit for how long they can be Inactive before being deleted, ie removed unless the Recipient activates their account within a given period of time.

        <aside class="notice">
        Note: Usage of inactive content is only allowed in certain specific cases and its usage needs to be regulated in the business relationship between the sender party and Kivra.
        </aside>

        Sending inactive Content uses all the same attributes as a normal Content with the difference for some additional metadata-attributes.
        By enabling the `retain` metadata attribute and setting it to `true` will enable possible retention of a Content. Kivra’s logic is to first look if the Recipient exist. If it does Kivra will deliver the Content as usual, if the Recipient doesn’t exist Kivra will retain the Content for the default amount of time (*30 days*). This makes it easy for an Integrator to issue a "retain or deliver"-logic for all it’s Contents.

        If an integrator want to retain a Content for a another time-period than Kivra’s default if can be done via the `retention_time` additional metadata.

      description: |
        Kivra supports Oauth2 with Client Credentials flow. Each client has a `client_id` and a `client_secret` and these need to be base64 encoded and sent to the API via POST to receive an access token which is used for subsequent calls.

        > Create the RFC 2045 base64 encoding to be used for tenant registration, replace `client_id` and `client_secret` with real values and make sure there are no trailing newlines (echo -n) and that the string is encoded literally (use single quotes and no escaping)

        ```bash
        $ echo -n 'client_id:client_secret' | base64
        Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudF9zZWNyZXQ=
        ```

        > Then perform the authentication which will respond with an access token.

        > ### REQUEST: Authentication

        ```bash
        curl -i -X POST https://api.kivra.com/v1/auth \
           -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
           -H "Authorization: Basic Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudF9zZWNyZXQ="
        ```

        > ### RESPONSE: Authentication

        ```bash
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Server: nginx
        Date: Thu, 02 Oct 2014 12:43:25 GMT
        Content-Type: application/json
        Content-Length: 124
        Connection: keep-alive
        Vary: Accept-Encoding
        Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000;

        {
          "state":"",
          "access_token":"H6Zq08rF5fjQttd6fTKepWb3FQNptcip",
          "expires_in":28800,
          "scope":"kivra.v1.tenant.{tenant-key}.*",
          "token_type":"bearer"
        }
        ```

        <aside class="notice">
        An access_token is valid for eight(8) hours.
        </aside>

        A new `access_token` can be requested any time. If a request to the API is issued with a non valid `access_token` a http-response with the HTTP-header 401 is returned such as `HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized`. With the use of a `valid access_token` request to the API can be done as the example below.

        <aside class="warning">
        Note: Client Credentials and Access Tokens needs to be treated securely, It is how you securely identify your application's rights and identity when accessing the Kivra API. Do not distribute Client Credentials or Access Tokens in email, distributed native applications, client-side javascript, or public code repositories.
        </aside>

        > ### Example request with `access_token`

        ```bash
        curl -i -X GET -H "Authorization: token <access_token>" <api-url-to-object>
        ```
        ## Authorization with limited access scope

        In some particular configuration, for instance when a centralized service wants to provide a satellite service with possibility to only send content to Kivra for a specific tenant, but not allowing any other operation, the centralized service may request an access token for a specific tenant with a limited scope. This access token can be safely provided to the satellite service.

        To retrieve this access token, the client performs a new authorization with some extra parameters specifying the limited scope.

        ```shell
        curl -X POST \
          https://api.kivra.com/v1/auth \
          -d grant_type=client_credentials \
          -d scope=post:kivra.v1.tenant.{tenant-key}.content \
          -H "Authorization: Basic {base64-auth}"
        ```

        > The answer will look like the following:

        ```json
        {
            "state": "",
            "access_token": "DMWmtGWe9YpXep6FTgVEwWttxLR6D53z",
            "expires_in": 28800,
            "scope": "post:kivra.v1.tenant.{tenant-key}.content",
            "token_type": "bearer"
        }
        ```
        ### Scope
        Scopes are specified as one or a commaseparated list of methods with a path appended and separated by `:`.

        Method is a lower case string of one or more of the allowed methods, valid examples:

        | Example        | Details                                                    |
