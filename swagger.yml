    # Receipt API
    The Receipt API, used to send digital receipts to users in Kivra, is available [here](http://developer.kivra.com/receipt/posapi/index.html).

    # Introduction
    This document is intended for developers and others who are interested in integrating with [Kivra Sweden](https://www.kivra.se) to send digital mail. Questions can be sent to [avsandare.support@kivra.com](mailto:avsandare.support@kivra.com) or via [our contact form](https://kivra.se/sv/foretag/skicka/intresseanmalan).
    If anything is missing or seems incorrect, please check the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kivra/developer.kivra.com/issues) for existing known issues or [create a new issue](https://github.com/kivra/developer.kivra.com/issues/new).

    ## National versions of Kivra APIs
    As local requirements and regulations might affect the way one interacts with the API, it's important to look for the version of the Kivra API specific for the Country where you intend to operate.

    This version of the API is about **Kivra Sweden**.

    ## Api version: v1 and v2
    We currently have some endpoints in v1 and some endpoints in v2. Each endpoint documented here specifies in the URL whether the endpoint requires v1 or v2.

    Authentication is the same for both v1 and v2.

    ## Introduction to API integration
    The Kivra API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable,
    resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors.

    Integration in its simplest form consists of two steps:

      1. The first step is to match the Recipient-databases either as a whole or one by one and see which Recipients the tenant can send contents to
      2. The second step is to send the contents itself.

    A prerequisite for these two steps is to have client credentials, to be authorized to use the Kivra API, and a tenant ID to specify who is the sender of the content.


    ## The service
    Kivra is a secure digital mailbox tied to your personal or company identity
    in which you receive documents from companies, organizations
    and government agencies that are connected to Kivra. With Kivra you can
    receive, manage and archive your content wherever you are and on every
    platform as long as you have an internet connection.

    Over one billion window envelopes are sent every year in Sweden alone, so
    by choosing to use Kivra you contribute to a reduced carbon footprint!

    Kivra acts as a digital postman between Sender and Recipients which is
    also reflected in the allocation of responsibilities. Concretely, this
    means that the Sender is responsible for the design and content whereas
    Recipients are responsible for reading and processing the received content.

    ## Policy for personal or sensitive Information in the metadata
    It is not allowed to include personal or sensitive data in any of the free-text metadata fields.

    Sensitive personal data includes the data referred to in article 9.1. GDPR (data concerning racial or ethnic origin,
    political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union, health, a person's sex life or
    sexual orientation, genetic data, biometric data that is being used to uniquely identify a person), and this means
    for example that it is not allowed to state the reason for a booking in either of the Title field or the Description
    field when sending medical care notices.

    The sender is responsible for ensuring no personal or sensitive personal data is included in any of the free-text metadata fields.

    # Change Mangement
    The Kivra API is continuously improved and new features may be added at any time. Major changes are announced
    via the [KivraStatus](https://www.kivrastatus.se) service.

    Disruptive changes in the API that may break existing integrations, as for instance removal of an older version of an API endpoint, are announced via [KivraStatus](https://www.kivrastatus.se) at least 6 months before the change becomes operative.

    We strongly recommend to subscribe to [KivraStatus](https://www.kivrastatus.se) in order to get updates for the API.

    # Terminology
    ### User
    An end user who is a user of Kivra and receives Content from tenants. A user is a physical person.
    Users are required to login at least once every 12 month to be considered active. A user that has not logged in since longer than 12 months will no longer be listed for matching to inform the tenant that they should not send content to this user.
    A user can also become `dormant` or deactivate themselves and be put under a `grace period`. Both these states are to aid the Tenant in making sure that only active Users are available for receiving Content.
    See below for more information on Dormant and Grace period.

    ### Company
    A Company is a judicial person that can receive content from tenants. Users that are signatories to the company have access to the company’s mailbox and archive. Other Users that are not signatories may also be given access to a company’s mailbox and archive. A Company can become `dormant` or deactivated by users that are signatories to the company. Both these states is to aid the Tenant in making sure that only active Companies are available for receiving Content. See below for more information on Dormant and Grace period.

    ### Non-user
    A non-user is an individual who is not a customer of Kivra but could be addressed by tenants in specific flows like the *retain functionality* or *signatures*.

    ### Recipient
    A Company, a User or a non-user in the context of being a receiver. Throughout this document Recipient is used to interchangeably mean a User or Company being a receiver.

    ### Tenant / Integrator
    Tenant is a sender that is integrated with Kivra. They need not be integrated directly, but can go through an integrator. The integrator acts as intermediary for the tenant at integration and can handle multiple tenants.

    ### Partner
    Partner is a third-party company (typically an ERP company) that may be granted access to access and process a company's mailbox, on behalf of the company.

    ### Content
    The information sent by Tenants to Recipients, i.e. Documents, Invoices, etc.

    ### Dormant Recipient
    Recipient who can’t be reached by email and sms-notifications are put in a "dormant"-state. During this dormant state the Recipient won’t show up in any of user or company matching functionalities but the Tenant can still send Content which the Recipient will receive. When a Recipient log-in again they are awaken from dormant state and will start appearing in the matching functionalities again.

    ### Grace period
    Kivra employs a `10` day grace period when a Recipient deactivates. During this grace period the Recipient won’t show up in any of user or company matching functionalities but the Tenant can still send Content which the Recipient will receive.

    ### User object
    is a data object that contains all the available information about a user

    ### Company object
    is a data object that contains all the available information about a company

    ### Tenant object
    is a data object that contains all the available information about a sender.

    ### Content object
    is a data object that contains information about the document and the document itself

    ### Retained functionality
    For tenants wishing to send content to Recipients who are at the time not existing in Kivra’s database.
    Kivra will then store the content for the agreed period of time and deliver it once/if the target Recipient
    registers with Kivra within this period of time.

    <aside class="notice">
    Note: Usage of retained functionality is only allowed for documents of type credit notice and salary slip.
    </aside>

    ### Tenant key
    Is a unique key that identifies a Tenant.

    ### Metadata
    is data about data or information about data. Originally, the concept of meta-information, ie information about information. Normally metadata describes the content and / or structure for a given data collection from any perspective. Kivra uses metadata to determine whom a content is to be sent to and other information that may be relevant for a shipment, as for instance payment information.

    ### Json
    Json or JavaScript Object Notation is a structured approach to data management. Similar to XML but much simpler and easier to read. JSON is the default serialization format  within the Kivra system. JSON have a limited set of types and close attention needs to be paid to the correct JSON-type for metadata when sending Content to Kivra.

    # Conventions
    ## Date & Time
    KIVRA encodes and decodes all dates and times as [ISO 8601](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) values. The format looks like `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD`, example `1970-01-01T23:25:10.0330000+01:00` where:

    * `YYYY`, The year including century
    * `MM`, Month
    * `DD`, Day
    * `T`, Separator
    * `hh`, Zero-padded hour between `00` and `24` (where `24` is only used to notate midnight at the end of a calendar day)
    * `mm`, Zero-padded minutes between `00` and `59`
    * `ss`, Zero-padded second between `00` and `60` (where `60` is only used to notate an added leap second)
    * `s`, one or more digits representing a decimal fraction of a second
    * `TZD`, Time zone designator (`Z` or `+hh:mm` or `-hh:mm`)

    ## UTC
    If the time is in UTC, add a `Z` directly after the time without a space. `Z` is the zone designator for the zero UTC offset. `09:30 UTC` is therefore represented as `09:30Z` or `0930Z`. `14:45:15 UTC` would be `14:45:15Z` or `144515Z`. UTC time is also known as 'Zulu' time, since 'Zulu' is the NATO phonetic alphabet word for `Z`.

    The offset from UTC is given in the format `±[hh]:[mm]`, `±[hh][mm]`, or `±[hh]`. So if the time being described is one hour ahead of UTC (such as the time in Stockholm during the winter), the zone designator would be `+01:00`, `+0100`, or simply `+01`. This is appended to the time in the same way that `Z` was above. The offset from UTC changes with daylight saving time, e.g. a time offset in Chicago, would be `-06:00` for the winter (Central Standard Time) and `-05:00` for the summer (Central Daylight Time).

    Please note that we always expect date & time to be specified as UTC or having an explicit timezone. Time & date fields without any time zone designator will be interpreted as UTC.

    ## Media types
    The [IANA](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) media types, e.g. "application/pdf"

    ## UTF-8 encoding
    All data sent to Kivra needs to be [UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoded.

    ## Currency
    All places where currency is specified, [ISO4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) should be used.

    ## Country code
    Where applicable KIVRA uses a country code to determine certain formats. The country code should always be supplied using the [ISO 3166-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) alpha-2 two-letter code.

    ## Email address
    Email addresses needs to be specified using [E.123](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.123)

    ## Phone numbers (mobile, land line)
    All phone numbers needs to be specified using [E.123](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.123)

    ## Identifying users
    Kivra uses the social security number/personal-number as key when accepting content. The format must adhere to the format `YYYYMMDDnnnn` that is including century-digits, i.e. `191212121212`.

    ## VAT number
    In many countries, companies (or even individuals) are registered with authorities responsible for collecting taxes derived from the business transactions performed by the companies. That registration commonly yields a registration number, which uniquely identifies that company within the domain of the authority. Some legislation has a concept of VAT grouping, in which case the structure of the VAT number may reflect the grouping by e.g. suffixing the number.

    The full identifier starts with an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (except for Greece which uses the non-standard country code EL) and then has between `2` and `12` characters. The identifiers are composed of numeric digits in most countries, but in some countries they may contain letters.

    Kivra only handles and recognizes Swedish VAT numbers ("momsregistreringsnummer")  which is composed of the prefix `SE` followed by 10 digits (an organisation number) followed by `01`. As an example, Kivra AB's VAT number is: `SE556840226601`.

    # Limits
    Kivra handles millions of documents. We put limits to protect the system from receiving more data than it can handle, and to ensure an equitable distribution of system resources. There’s also various practical reasons for this, such as reducing Head-of-line blocking and providing a optimal experience for the enduser.

    Our policies are as follows and are subject to change.

    ### Content File-size
    `1 MB` per **Content** per **Recipient**. This is the total JSON-object. For example, if you send two PDF’s embedded in a JSON-Content to a User the total for the JSON have to have a size less than `1 MB`.

    ### Rate limit
    `50` **contents** to the same **recipient** per minute. You can send many more contents per minute as long as they are to different receivers, but only up to `50` to the same recipient.

    ### Payload size
    Unless specified otherwise the payload for all requests have a max limit of `10MB`. Requests with payload larger than the max size will be rejected with error 413.

    # Interacting with the API
    All API access is performed over HTTPS through sender.[api, sandbox-api].kivra.com and data is sent and received as [JSON](http://www.json.org/). For trying out the API without touching live data we’ve set up a sandbox environment.
    In order to ensure data privacy the following choices have been made, to name some that directly impact API workflows:
    Unencrypted HTTP is not supported, you will be redirected to the resource you tried to reach, with http replaced by https, if you attempt to use plain HTTP.
    Resources you have no right to see will either give you a describing status code or a `404`. `404` statuses are returned if the case is such that you don’t even have the right to know, according to the system's current state, if an object exists.

    ## API Endpoints
    Kivra uses different endpoints for production and testing as described below. We also provide the current IP addresses that *could* serve API requests, the current DNS-record will provide an up-to-date list with active endpoints. This is not meant to be a complete list of Kivra-maintained IP addresses. Please make sure to **always** access the Kivra API using the correct domain-name and environment instead of relying on IP addresses.

    Kivra maintains a infrastructure, which grows dynamically to accommodate increasing demand. As a result, Kivra API servers use a range of IP addresses, and the addresses often change.

    *Please note that we do not recommend managing firewall restrictions by IP address, as the IPs associated with these domains are not static.*

    <aside class="notice">
    All interaction with Kivra's APIs must be done over HTTPS.
    </aside>

    ### Production environment
    The API endpoint for the production environment can be found at

    `https://sender.api.kivra.com`

    The production environment should only be used for sending real data, not for testing of any sort. For testing, please refer to Sandbox.

    ### Sandbox environment
    The API for the sandbox environment can be found at

    `https://sender.sandbox-api.kivra.com`

    The sandbox is not to be used with any critical or production data. We make no guarantees as to the availability of the service, or the data stored by it.

    We usually deploy the latest production environment to our Sandbox, but may occasionally update it with newer builds, which may not be as reliable or well tested.

    The Sandbox environment cannot be used for capacity or volume tests as it has a much smaller capacity and performance than our production environment.

    ## URL Components
    When constructing resource identifiers (URIs) it is best to consider them as being built with up to four discrete units.

    ### Endpoint
    `https://sender.TYPE.kivra.com`

    ### Version
    `/VERSION`

    ### Tenant resource
    `/tenant/TENANTKEY`

    ### Parameters
    `/?QUERYSTRING`

    ## Unit Fields
    The units have parameterized fields, which allow you to change their respective meanings, those fields are briefly described below.

    ### TYPE
    `sandbox-api` for development and test or `api` for production purposes.

    ### VERSION
    Current API version is `v1` but some endpoint are already available as `v2`

    ### KEY
    The identifier of an object in a collection, its ID, if you will.

    ### QUERYSTRING
    A set of key-value pairs, used for filtering and setting options on collections.

    ## HTTP Verbs
    Where possible, the KIVRA API strives to use appropriate HTTP verbs for each action. The terms verb and method are used interchangingly.

    ### Idempotency
    The API supports idempotency for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. For example, if a request that is idempotent fails due to a network connection error, you can safely retry the request.

    `GET` and `DELETE` requests are idempotent by definition, meaning that the same backend work will occur no matter how many times the same request is issued. You shouldn't send an idempotency key with these verbs because it will have no effect.

    In short, this means that making a request with an idempotent verb only changes the state of the data the first time the request is made.

    ## Methods
    Read more about [HTTP/1.1 Method Definitions](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html).

    | Method      | Details                                                    |
    | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
    | GET         | Used to read a resource, be it a collection or an object. That is, it can be performed repeatedly without changing the state of the resource |
    | POST        | Used for creating resources, or performing custom or batch type actions |
    | PUT         | Used for updating resources or collections, but can also be used to create a resource when the key has been predetermined. Note that `PUT` apply to the entire resource and not just parts of it. So, when doing a `PUT` operation, the entire resource is replaced |
    | DELETE      | Used for deleting resources. Delete is atomic and acts on the whole resource, that is it can not be used to delete a part or alter the state of a resource. Use `PUT` for that |

    # Resource Types
    There are two main types of resources – objects and collections of objects, they are individually outlined in the following sections.
    It can generally be said that if a URL ends with a unique identifier (also known as a key), it is an object or a sub-object. Resources ending with collection names are collection resources.

    ## Object Resources
    Objects are mostly real-world things, such as a user, tenant to name a few, but they can also be abstract things, like a sendrequest.

    An example: */v1/tenant/13443459078e31ba8630e2e9842906c7baf38b131e*

    ### Allowed Methods
    **GET**
    Read the representation of an object as it is accessible and viewable by you.

    **PUT**
    Update the object. If the object doesn’t already exist, it is created.

    **PATCH**
    Update the object with the specified attributes.

    **DELETE**
    Irreversably delete the designated resource from the entire system. This operation will in most cases be illegal for regular API consumers.

    ## Collection Resources
    Collections are conceptually lists of objects, that can be queried. Queries without any parameters will cause a listing of the keys that are used to identify the objects within the collection; adding parameters will either filter which keys show up or decorate the keys with the object they identify (in part or entirely).

    When a collection resource is queried it will only return the list of keys that identify the objects it contains. If you want to see the actual objects you have to append the query parameter include=body to the URI, more on this below.

    An example: */v2/tenant*

    ### Allowed Methods
    **GET**
    List objects under the Collection, either all or using filters to search.

    **POST**
    Create a new object under the Collection.

    ## Filters and Flags
    In order to facilitate filtering/searching amongst the API objects, we provide the possibility to pass certain query string parameters that indicate which objects to include in the response and how they should be treated.

    ### Filters
    When searching for an object, it is suggested that you list the appropriate collection and add query parameters for the features of the object(s) you are trying to find in the URI. For example, when looking for if a user exists and is addressable for this Tenant, the resulting URL would be as follows `/tenant/TKEY/user/?ssn=SSN`

    ### Flags
    As mentioned, collections only list the keys of their member objects, which might inconvenience you by forcing you to make individual GET requests for each key in the list. In order to not waste bandwidth or time from setup and teardown of connections we supply the include flag. The include parameter currently accepts one of two values, body and fields, which indicate that you want the entire object or that you want a specific subset of the available fields, respectively.

    **Note:** When the include parameter is set to fields it is assumed that you will also pass a fields parameter with a comma-separated list of names, declaring which fields you want to view.

    # Tenants integration: Content management

    Tenants integration allows *tenants* and *integrators* to send *content* to *recipents* via Kivra.

    Tenants and integrator will use the `tenant` endpoint to integrate with Kivra.

    Before looking at the details of the integration, let's look at the concept of "opt-out" and its implication for tenant integration.

    ## Opt-out
    Kivra uses a method called opt-out to make the service as easy as possible for Recipients and Senders. Opt-out means that when a Recipient register with Kivra they’ll automatically receive documents from all Tenants connected to Kivra. Recipients do not need to enable individual Tenants to start receiving Content.

    ### Meaning of Opt-out for:

    #### Tenant

    Tenants can start sending Content to all Recipients in Kivra.

    When Tenant signs up new customers they can check (match) if that `SSN` or `VAT`-number is available as recipient in Kivra. If so, they can start sending content to them directly.

    A Recipient can choose to disable (opt-out) a Tenant. In that case, that user or company will no longer show up as available in Kivra for that tenant. A `10`-day grace period will start to take effect to allow tenants to match their register. During this grace period the Tenant can still post content to the recipient.

    #### Recipients

    Recipients will automatically start receiving Content from new Tenants.

    Recipients can choose to disable (opt-out) a Tenant. In that case, that Recipient will no longer show up as available in Kivra for that tenant. A `10`-day grace period will start to take effect to allow tenants to match their register. During this grace period the Tenant can still post content to the recipient.

    Recipients needs to login at least once every 12 months to be considered active, and show up as available for the tenants.

    ## Typical flow for content management

    The typical flow for sending content to recipients is illustrated here:

    ![Send Content to Kivra - Basic Flow](https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/3774eaa4-e877-49e8-86d3-0470f95f9b05/image.png)

    ## Step 1: Matching Recipients

    An integration starts by matching which Recipients can receive Content from the Tenant. Trying to send Content to Recipients not available to that tenant (either because they are not Kivra users or because they opt-out from that tenant) will be denied unless that Recipient is in a `10` days’ grace period with that Tenant.

    This means that for each Tenant the Recipient-request is unique and therefore integrators managing several Tenants need to keep track of the different Recipients for each of the Tenants.

    Matching of Recipients is done via the `usermatch` and `companymatch` resources.

    Matching of Recipients is strongly recommended with the exception of flows using the "retain" functionality.

    ## Step 2: Send Content

    Sending of Content is done via the `content` resource. The metadata in the `content` resource identifies the user and also determines how the recipient can interact with the content.

    ## Typical integration flows

    The Kivra API is typically integrated in different data flows, resulting in many different scenarios. In this paragraph we will describe few of these typical scenarios and provide some tips on how to use the API in that context.

    ### Daily document sending

    In this scenario the sender needs to send a large amount of documents each day, some of which is sent via Kivra, the rest via ordinary post. There is therefore need for knowing very early in the process whether a document can be sent via Kivra or needs to be printed and sent by ordinary post.

    The sender uses the API to match the recipient database, typically during the night, and use the recipient database to select which documents to be sent via Kivra and which need to be printed and sent via ordinary post.

    Even if the recipient database have been matched, it is still important to check the result of the API operation when sending content, as some recipient might have become unavailable in the time between the matching of the recipient database and the sending of the document. In this case the API will answer with an error code (typically `40105`). The documents that could not be sent via API will need to be sent via ordinary post, typically as part of tomorrow's batch.

    ### Payslips and retain functionality

    Payslips are typically small batches of documents sent once a month that can be handled using a simpler flow, not including the matching step but using the retain functionality instead.

    In this approach the sender sends all documents without checking if the user is a Kivra user or not, relying on the retain functionality instead. Content sent to non-Kivra users will be retained for a period of time (typically `390` days for payslips), meaning that it is kept by Kivra but not delivered. If the user creates a Kivra account before the retention period expires, the user will get all retained content. If the user does not create a Kivra account before the retention period expires, the content will be removed from Kivra.

    ### Payments and invoices

    Kivra allows to send both payable invoices (that might be paid via Kivra applications) or payment notifications that cannot be paid via Kivra, as for instance notification of autogiro payments.

    `payable` is the field in the metadata controlling whether the document should be payable via Kivra applications or not. As Kivra uses the information provided in the metadata to actually perform the payment, it is very important that metadata in the `payment` section is correct.

    Invoices can have multiple payment options. That means that while the recipient of the payment is the same for the entire invoice, some specifics of the payment can vary. The details are described further down in this document, but in general each option can have its own amount, reference information and due date. If there are more than one option, each of them must have a short title, and may have a longer description as well as its own icon.

    If an invoice has more than one payment option, the first option is treated specially. All notifications are based on the due date in the first option, and if a user accesses an invoice in an older client that is not aware of the multiple-option functionality, it will only display the information from the first option. Because of this, it is important that the first option always is to pay the entire debt, or, more generally, that paying the first option will release the user from any further obligation related to that particular invoice.

    If there are between one and seven payment options, there may also be a _flexible option_. This is meant to present the payer with the opportunity to choose how much they want to pay, within given limits. It is given specially under the key `flexible_option` rather than included in the normal options list. The object under the key shares some options with normal options, but does not specify a specific amount. Instead it has four optional keys giving mandatory and suggested limits for the lowest and highest amounts to be paid. Suggested limits will be used by the clients for prompting, hard limits will be enforced by both clients and backend.

    # Tenant integration: Tenant management

    With the introduction of `v2` of the Tenant management API, the client has the possibility to manage the tenants programmatically. In more details the client may:

    * Create a tenant
    * List all tenants that the client has currently access to
    * Update and manage which companies the tenant represents
    * Manage and update the display information of a tenant, meaning the sender name and the icon displayed in the Kivra apps to represent the sender
    * Request access to a tenant that is currently managed by some other client

    # Tenant integration: Agreements

    Agreements integration allows *tenants* and *integrators* to send content to be signed via Kivra's signature service. Content to be signed is sent to a list of receivers (signers or delegates, see below) who may login to [signatures.kivra.com](https://signatures.kivra.com/), identify themselves and sign the document via BankId. Upon signature by all parties, the agreement is completed and a new content is created (the covenant file, see below) including the original content plus a signing log listing all signers and information about the signature. Covenant files can be verified cryptographically to make sure that the information included (both original content and signing log) is correct and has not been altered after creation.

    Kivra's agreement service is not directly connected to Kivra's mailbox, and parties in an agreement do not need to be users of Kivra to use the service. However signers that are users of Kivra (or become Kivra users during the signing process) will have the benefit that the covenant file will be automatically transferred to their mailbox once the agreement is signed.

    Note: the Signatures service works best when the original PDF content is an A4 document with all its pages in portrait mode. If size and orientation are different,
    the resulting covenant might look stretched, while the original document (included in the covenant) will be preserved in its original
    size and orientation.

    ## Signers, Delegates and Parties

    Each individual signer in an agreement is categorized as either `signer`or `delegate`:

    * a `signer` signs an agreement as an individual, for instance in the scenario of an employment agreement, the `signer` is the person receiving an employment offer. Each agreement must have at least one `signer`. Signer(s) do not need to be users of Kivra.
    * a `delegate` signs an agreement as representative for a company, for instance in the scenario of an employment agreement the `delegate` is typically the HR manager sending the employment offer. To have a `delegate` in an agreement is not mandatory, in case the agreement only requires to be signed by the signer(s). Delegate(s) do not need to be users of Kivra.
    * 'parties' refers to the `signers` and `delegates` in an agreement.

    ## Agreement states

    During its lifetime, an agreement can go through various states. The current state can be accessed by getting the agreement via the signature API:

    ### State active

    This is the inital state of the agreement after a successful create. During user actions on the agreement the state remains as `active`. The states that an active agreement can transition to are referred to as *terminal* states, meaning it's the end of the agreement lifecycle.

    If an agreement do not transition to a terminal state within 30 days from its creation, it will expire and it will be removed from all our services.

    ### State generating

    When the last of all parties sign the agreement, the agreement transition to state `generating` while the covenant PDF is generated
    and all necessary operations required for PAdES are applied to it. The `generating` state will then automatically transition to `completed`
    as soon as the covenant file is ready.

    ### State completed

    Agreements automatically transitions to the state `completed` at the time when the last of all parties sign the agreement and the covenant file is ready. When an agreement has been completed, it is forever under the terminal state completed and can never transition back to an active state or be acted upon by any party. In other words, no one can change a completed agreement.

    When an agreement becomes completed, a covenant file is created (see below). The covenant file will be availabe to the tenant via the signature API, and to the signers and delegates via the graphical interface.

    No one can change a signed agreement and the agreement along with all data and files relating to the agreement will be completely removed from all our services after `30` days from the date it became completed.

    ### State revoked

    This state can be triggered by a tenant who owns the agreement. If the agreement is *active*, the tenant can choose to revoke the agreement at any time. When an agreement has been revoked, it is forever under the terminal state revoked and can never transition back to an active state or be acted upon by any party. No one can sign a revoked agreement and the agreement along with all data and files relating to the agreement will be completely removed from all our services within `30` days after the date it was created.

    ## Agreement verification and covenant file

    When the agreement transitions to the `completed` state, a few more things happen. An additional PDF file, a signed version of the original agreement, is created. This file is called the `covenant file`. The covenant file includes the original agreement and some additional pages including Bank ID data for the signatures and additional information about the signing events. The covenant file is accessible for `30` days to the tenant and all parties, after that it is removed from all services, together with the initial descriptive data for the original agreement. However, we construct a new data structure that we store persistently and that will be used for verification: a `256bit` string value constructed through an internal algorithm that we refer to as `verification value`.

    The verification value is used solely for verification purposes. This means that if you have access to the signed document, you can use this for verification through our services where we run the obtained file through our internal algorithm to produce the value string for that exact file.

    Since 2022-03-15 the covenant file is also digitally signed according to PAdES (PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures). PAdES is a standard for digital signatures which is adopted by the European eIDAS standard, meaning that agreements signed according to PAdES are legally binding in all EU member states since July 2014. For more information on PAdES: [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAdES) or [EU e-Signature page](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/CEFDIGITAL/Standards+and+specifications). This means that covenant PDFs produced by Kivra Signatures are self-bearing and their validity and authenticity can be easily determined by free PDF readers like Abobe Acrobat Reader, completely independently of Kivra. The PAdES signature can also be verified programmatically if one would like to do so.

    For more information on how we handle PDF files in Kivra Signatures and PAdES, please refer to [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OFBI3wa1iDxzGrbXY0o1HMavGJCLrNCU2Pt-1EdQTmI/edit?usp=sharing).
    ## Notifications

    After creating the agreement, the tenant is responsible to inform the parties that there is a document waiting to be signed at [signatures.kivra.com](http://signatures.kivra.com/).
    After the users access the Kivra signature service and agree to its terms of service, Kivra will notify signers when the document has been signed by all and is ready to be downloaded or transferred to the Kivra mailbox, using the contact information provided by the tenant.

    ## Signature flow

    1. The tenant posts an agreement providing the PDF document to be signed and the list of parties, and gets back an `agreement id`. Parties are specified by their role, a SSN number and an email. The agreement is made available by Kivra to the parties.
    2. The tenant uses the document ID to check the agreement status. The agreement can also be revoked by the tenant, as long as it has not reached the `completed` state.
    3. Once the document has become `completed`, the tenant can download the `covenant file` via the API and save it, while parties have different options based on whether they are users of Kivra or not: for Kivra user the covenant file will be automatically transferred to the Kivra mailbox; for non Kivra user, parties have `30` days to either become a Kivra user and get the covenant file in the Kivra mailbox, or download the covenant file from the signature service for personal storage.
    4. The agreement is removed from all our services `30` days after creation in case the agreement does not reach the completed state. The agreement and covenant file are removed from all our services `30` days after the agreement reached the completed state. Once the agreement and covenant file have been removed, there will be no option for recovering them, only the verification option will be available. So it is important that both tenant and signers make sure that they have saved and safely stored the covenant file.

    # Partners integration

    Partners integration allows a *company recipient* to open up its mailbox to a third party (a *partner*) to allow it to access and process the mailbox content. This is typically used by companies to allow bookkeeping and administrative third parties to access and process invoices and documents.

    Company recipients need to explicitly authorize a partner to access their content via a setting in their Kivra Company mailbox, and they can revoke access at any time. Both granting and revoking of access are performed via the Kivra app.

    Partners will use the `partner` endpoint to integrate with Kivra.

    # Errors

    Kivra uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

    In general:

    * Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success.
    * Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, invalid data, etc.).
    * Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Kivra's servers or a timeout. In this case it is safe to retry the request.

    ## Error handling

    The integrator needs proper handling of common errors. Errors can happen at any stage and Kivra will report back to let the integrator take appropriate action.

    ### Recipient-file matching:

    Common errors that can occur and need to be handled gracefully.

    * Network problem that hinders the integrator from communicating with Kivra
    * Problem on Kivra’s end that hinders the integrator from querying the state of **Recipients**

    These errors should be handled gracefully such that the last working download of a **Recipient**-file is used until the problem has been solved and a new **Recipient**-file can be downloaded and used.

    ### Content Delivery:

    Common errors that can occur and need to be handled gracefully.

    * Network problem that hinders the integrator from communicating with Kivra resulting in either not being able to reach Kivra or a non-successful response-code
    * Problem with the **input**-file either due to above(network problem) or other such as corrupt data or invalid metadata.

    ## Error Messages

    When the KIVRA API returns error messages, it does so in a extended JSON format.

    > ### Example error response

    ```bash
    { "code"          : 40400
    , "short_message" : "Resource not found"
    , "long_message"  : "There's no resource at the given URI."
    }
    ```

    ### An error has three properties:

    | Property      | Description                                                |
    | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
    | code          | The Kivra [error code](#error-codes)                       |
    | short_message | A short description of the error                           |
    | long_message  | A longer and more verbose error message                    |

    Extra properties, for further context, can also exist in the error object, for which
    `long_message` should include human-readable information on how to proceed.
    These are documented on a per-path/verb basis.

    ## Extended error code

    The 5-digits extended error code is provided both in the body of the response and in the `x-error-code` filed of the response header.

    ## Error codes

    In addition to descriptive error text, error messages contain machine-parseable codes.
    While the text for an error message may change, the codes will stay the same.
    The following table describes the codes which may appear when working with the API:

    | Code | Short Message | Long Message |

    ## Troubleshooting
    In case you're experiencing problems interacting with the API, make sure to collect the correlation id and provide our sender support
    (avsandare.support@kivra.com) with this information.
    The correlation Id can be found in the `x-correlation-id` header of all of Kivra's API responses.

    # API - Authentication
    Kivra supports Oauth2 with Client Credentials flow. Each client has a `client_id` and a `client_secret` and these need to be base64 encoded and sent to the API via POST to receive an access token which is used for subsequent calls.

    Create the RFC 2045 base64 encoding to be used for tenant registration, replace `client_id` and `client_secret` with real values and make sure there are no trailing newlines (echo -n) and that the string is encoded literally (use single quotes and no escaping)

    ```bash
    $ echo -n 'client_id:client_secret' | base64
    Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudF9zZWNyZXQ=
    ```

    Then perform the authentication which will respond with an access token.

    ### REQUEST: Authentication

    ```bash
    curl -i -X POST https://sender.api.kivra.com/v1/auth \
     -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
     -H "Authorization: Basic Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudF9zZWNyZXQ="
    ```

    ### RESPONSE: Authentication

    ```bash
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: nginx
    Date: Thu, 02 Oct 2014 12:43:25 GMT
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 124
    Connection: keep-alive
    Vary: Accept-Encoding
    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000;

    {
    "state":"",
    "access_token":"H6Zq08rF5fjQttd6fTKepWb3FQNptcip",
    "expires_in":28800,
    "scope":"kivra.v1.tenant.{tenant-key}.*",
    "token_type":"bearer"
    }
    ```

    <aside class="notice">
    An access_token is valid for eight(8) hours.
    </aside>

    A new `access_token` can be requested any time. If a request to the API is issued with a non valid `access_token` a http-response with the HTTP-header 401 is returned such as `HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized`. With the use of a `valid access_token` request to the API can be done as the example below.

    <aside class="warning">
    Note: Client Credentials and Access Tokens needs to be treated securely, It is how you securely identify your application's rights and identity when accessing the Kivra API. Do not distribute Client Credentials or Access Tokens in email, distributed native applications, client-side javascript, or public code repositories.
    </aside>

    ### Example request with access_token

    ```bash
    curl -i -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" <api-url-to-object>
    ```
    ## Authorization with limited access scope

    In some particular configuration, for instance when a centralized service wants to provide a satellite service with possibility to only send content to Kivra for a specific tenant, but not allowing any other operation, the centralized service may request an access token for a specific tenant with a limited scope. This access token can be safely provided to the satellite service.

    To retrieve this access token, the client performs a new authorization with some extra parameters specifying the limited scope.

    ```shell
    curl -X POST \
    https://sender.api.kivra.com/v1/auth \
    -d grant_type=client_credentials \
    -d scope=post:kivra.v1.tenant.{tenant-key}.content \
    -H "Authorization: Basic {base64-auth}"
    ```

    The answer will look like the following:

    ```json
    {
      "state": "",
      "access_token": "DMWmtGWe9YpXep6FTgVEwWttxLR6D53z",
      "expires_in": 28800,
      "scope": "post:kivra.v1.tenant.{tenant-key}.content",
      "token_type": "bearer"
    }
    ```
    ### Scope
    Scopes are specified as one or a commaseparated list of methods with a path appended and separated by `:`.

    Method is a lower case string of one or more of the allowed methods, valid examples:

    | Example        | Details                                                    |
    | -----------    | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `post:path`    | Allows `POST` for the given path                           |
    | `get,put:path` | Allows `GET` and `PUT` for the given path                  |

    Path is a lower case string starting with the keyword `kivra` and the path appended and interspersed with `.` instead
    of the path-separator `/` such as: `kivra.v1.example`. There is also the possibility to use wildcards:

    | Wildcard       | Details                                                        |
    | -----------    | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `*`            | Marks a scope as valid for *any* keyword on **current-level**  |
    | `**`           | Marks a scope as valid for *any* keyword on **current-level** and **recursively**                 |

    <SecurityDefinitions/>

    # Payments: Swish support #

    A sender can designate Kivra as a Swish Technical Provider for them.

    A sender can then provide Kivra with one or more payee aliases.

    One payee alias _may_ be designated as the _default payee alias_.

    Contents sent to Kivra _may_ have a field in the payment data named
    `swish_alias`.

    If a sender has a default alias, all their payable contents that _do not_
    have the `swish_alias` field will have Swish payment offered, and those
    Swish payments will be sent to the default alias.

    If the sender does not have default alias and a content does not have a
    `swish_alias` field, Swish payment will not be offered.

    If a payable content has a `swish_alias` field and the content of that field
    is a Swish alias registered for the content's sender, Swish payment will be
    offered for the content, with the included Swish alias as the payment
    destination.

    If a payable content has a `swish_alias` field, and the content of that
    field is *not* a registered Swish alias for the sender, Swish payment will
    not be offered for that payment.

    If a sender has a default alias registered, and wants to exempt a specific
    content from Swish payment, this can be done by including a `swish_alias`
    field in it containing the string `disable` (this is really a special case
    of having an invalid alias).

    If the `swish_alias` field is included it must not be empty, since it would
    be unclear if that should be intepreted as not providing an alias, and thus
    getting a default used, or as being an invalid alias, and not having
    Swish payment offered at all.

    In all the cases above, the validity of a Swish alias specified in a content
    is evaluated at the time of payment, not when the content is received by Kivra.
    As a consequence of this, if a sender asks to have one of their alias
    removed, all old invoices that have that alias in their `swish_alias` fields
    will stop being payable with Swish.

      summary: Request access to a tenant

      description: |
        Request access to an existing tenant that is outside the client scope. Typically this request follows an unsuccessful attempt to create a tenant that resulted in a conflict error (error 409).

        The meaning of the conflict error is that a tenant is already associated to a `company_id` including the same `orgnr` as in the tenant that the client attempted to post, and the tenant who owns the `orgnr` is outside the scope for the client.

        In Kivra, it is allowed to have several different flows on the same tenant, for example one flow for invoices and another flow for salary slips. As these flows could be managed by different clients, we need a mechanism to allow sharing a tenant between clients.
        The `request_access` endpoint provide this functionality. As the request may be granted (or denied) asynchronously, after a successfull call to `request_access` the client will need to poll the request until it becomes `accepted` or `rejected`.

        As allowing access to a new tenant requires modification of the scope for the client, an authorization must be performed once the request has been accepted, to retrieve an access token with the new scope.

        If the client posts a new identical request (requesting the same `OrgNr` for the same client), the same object will be returned with an updated status.

      description: |
        LEGACY: This resource is only supported for existing customers, new integrations
        should use the `usermatch` resource.

        This resource is used to list users that were added/removed since
        `diffId` was obtained, either from an initial request to the
        `/v1/tenant/{tenantKey}/user` endpoint, or from a subsequent request
        to this endpoint. Note that all `diffId`s that are obtained in a
        series of requests expire 31 days after the **initial** request.
        Therefore, API users must fetch the complete user set at least once
        every 31 days.
        Also, due to the fact that grace period for users leaving Kivra is 10 days, after which
        all data about the user is erased from Kivra, it is crucial
        that a new DIFF is requested at least once every 10 days to make sure that the list
        of removed users is complete.

        Metadata is data that Kivra needs to send the Content to the right User. It may also determine how a User can interact with the Content.

        ## Minimum Metadata
        As a minimum one valid recipient identifier (`vat_number`, `ssn` or `email`), a `subject` and `type` are required.

        In case several identifiers are specified, Kivra will only try to match the first one and not fall through to try to match the remaining identifiers.
        More specifically Kivra will look first for a `vat_number`, if this is not provided it will look for a `ssn`, if this is not provided either it will look for `email`.

        E.g. if a content has both an `ssn` and `email`, only the `ssn` will be used as identifier, even if there is no positive `ssn` match.
        </aside>

        ## Responsive content
        As more than 90% of the content sent in Kivra is consumed on mobile devices, it is important to be able to show to the recipient the most important information in an easyly readable way, without relying on the recipient to zoom in on the area of the PDF where the information is presented.

         Responsive content solve this problem by allowing senders to provide 2 versions of the content:
          - a PDF which contains all the information and details that needs to be presented to the recipient
          - an HTML version of the same content that includes an overview of the information and highlights what the sender wants to present to the user.

        Here are a couple of examples on how to use HTML resp. PDF in your communication:
        - Let's consider an invoice where the PDF contains all the information that the invoice must include, while the responsive part (HTML) contains only the due amount, the due date, some information about the product or service that was delivered, the benefits for the customer for using the supplier and some brand information.
        -  Let's consider a salary specification where the PDF contains all the details and how the salary was calculated while the HTML presentes only some key information like the salary total, when the money will be paid and the number of vacation days left.

        ### Restrictions for the HTML part
        Kivra is an archive and it is very important that content sent in Kivra is immutable and does not update itself over time. The recipient should be able to return to a received content at any point in time and see it exactly as it was when it was received.

        As HTML is a format that offers many possibilities there are restrictions on how the HTML is formed:
        - No javascript: **no javascript allowed**, neither inline or fetched from external resources
        - External documents such as images, icons, css, etc. **must be embedded inline in the HTML** file to avoid external links to become bad over time and break the rendering of the HTML

        Privacy is also an important concern for Kivra. For this reason common links are allowed in the HTML but **no user-specific tracking links are allowed**, for instance links containing UTMs or other technology to track the behavior of each particular user.

        ## Retained Content
        A retained Content is a Content that is sent to a Recipient who is not yet a user of Kivra. Once that Recipient register with Kivra, the Content will be delivered to that Recipient’s Kivra account. Retained Content has a time limit for how long they can be retained before being deleted, ie removed unless the Recipient registers within a given period of time.

        <aside class="notice">
        Note: Usage of retained content is only allowed for documents of type credit notice and salary slip.
        </aside>

        Sending retained Content uses all the same attributes as a normal Content with the difference for some additional metadata-attributes.
        By enabling the `retain` metadata attribute and setting it to `true` will enable possible retention of a Content. Kivra’s logic is to first look if the Recipient exist. If it does Kivra will deliver the Content as usual, if the Recipient doesn’t exist Kivra will retain the Content for the specified amount of time (*30 days* is the default value if nothing else is specified). This makes it easy for an Integrator to issue a "retain or deliver"-logic for all it’s Contents.

        Integrators that want to retain a Content for a different time-period than Kivra’s default can use the `retention_time` metadata.

        ## Duplicate control
        If exactly the same payload (content plus metadata, with only exception being the `generated_at` field) is received more than once, only the first occurrence will result in a delivery. In the other occurrences an OK message will be returned, but no corresponding content will be delivered to the receiver. This is a security mechanism to allow senders to safely re-send the same payload in case there is uncertainty on whether the previous sending resulted in a delivery or not. A typical example is in case of timeout error, where the sender cannot establish whether the sending resulted in a content delivery or not.

        <aside class="notice">
        Note: Duplicate control is only available in production, not in sandbox. This allows senders to reuse the same payload several times in the test environment.
        </aside>

        It's important to underline that the duplicate control is made by checking the complete payload (beside `generated_at`), not only the attached content. This means that any change in the payload will cause the duplicate check to fail and the corresponding content to be delivered.

        Another important consequence is that in case a sender wants to safely re-send a PDF content, it is important that the PDF is not generated again between the API calls as this almost certainly results in a slightly different PDF and therefore in a different payload, meaning that the duplication check will not be able to recognise it as a duplicate.

        A form template is a list of questions you would like to ask users. When sending content you can attach a form you would like a user to complete.

        Form templates are owned by the client that created them. What this means is that only the client can call the response endpoints.
        However if the client has the tenant scope it can call form template endpoints and even include a form when sending content.

        ### How to send a form to the user
        When sending a content to the user include the form template key in the context object. See `Tenant API - Content` -> `Send content (v2)` for more information.

        ### Content metadata

        Get metadata about a specific content in JSON format.

        ### Content file data

        A given content can contain multiple files ("parts"). Fetching of such parts is done by passing the `part` query parameter.

        A part can also be selected by setting the `Accept` header to the MIME type of the part you want
        (see `parts` in the metadata JSON response). You will receive the first part that matches the given
        MIME type.

            least one fixed option, to allow for old clients that don't know how
            to deal with flexible options.
            The flexible option can have up to four limits: suggested maximum
            and minimum, and mandatory maximum and minimum. For the suggested
            limits, the user will be shown a warning when entering a sum outside
            them, but will be allowed to proceeed if they want to. The mandatory
            limits will be enforced, and paying amounts outside them will not be
            allowed. The closest behaviour to that of the old variable amount is
            achieved by setting `max_limit` and `min_suggested`.
