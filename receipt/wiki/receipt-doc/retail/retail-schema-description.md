# **_DR - Retail Schema Explained_**

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to explain the structure of a digital receipt based on the Kivra DR Retail JSON Schema (DRJSON).

DRJSON is made to conform to the Swedish fiscal law for cash registers. For detailed information, see [digital-receipt-schema.json](../../../schemas/json/retail/v1.0.json).

## Recommended reading

This document focuses on details in the digital receipt JSON structure. To simplify the understanding of the content of this document the following resources should be studied alongside:

- [Sample receipts](example-receipts.md)
- [Json schema and definition files](retail-schema-content.md)
- [Chapter 7.1, required receipt content according to Swedish tax authories](http://www4.skatteverket.se/download/18.23a7d9f315064c2d02960ef/1447256030870/SKVFS+2014+9.pdf)

## Scope

This document focuses on the construction and content of the digital receipt. It does not describe how the receipt is transferred from the issuer to the customer and how it is presented.

## Terminology

### POS

POS - Point of Sales, the system creating and delivering receipts to the customer. The term POS in this document can be any system creating a digital receipt.

### JSON - JavaScript Object Notation

In computing, JavaScript Object Notation, [JSON](https://www.json.org/), is an open-standard file format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value). [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)

### JSON Schema

JSON Schema is a powerful tool for validating the structure of JSON data. [(Understanding JSON Schema)](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/)

## DRJSON

This section covers the digital receipt schema and their corresponding POS data terms where relevant. For more information see the documentation in the [JSON schema specification](../../../schemas/json/retail/v1.0.json).

Main properties of the digital receipt schema.

```json
{
  "copy": "",
  "business_unit": {},
  "cashier": {},
  "sales_recording_system": {},
  "receipt_identifier": {},
  "time_of_purchase": "",
  "currency": "",
  "totals": [],
  "header_text": {},
  "footer_text": {},
  "items": [],
  "retail_price_modifiers": [],
  "payments": [],
  "customer": {},
  "customer_order": {},
  "control_unit": {}
}
```

The coming sections will describe each property in more detail.

### copy

_copy_ (boolean), indicates if the digital receipt is a copy (value _true_) or an original (value _false_). _false_ is default if the _copy property_ is missing.

### business_unit

Information about the merchant.

Example:

```json
{
  "business_unit": {
    "service_id": "15594097555922f97bfeb148d6b9a6ef76f76ebdce",
    "organization_number": "112233-4444",
    "name": "My store",
    "contact": {
      "address": {
        "street_address": "Merchant street",
        "locality": "Town",
        "postal_code": "11111"
      },
      "phone": "+4601122334455"
    }
  }
}
```

- _service_id_: The id given to the store when it is created in the Kivra Digital Receipt Platform.
- _organization_number_: The merchant [_organisationsnummer_](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisationsnummer)

### cashier

Optional information about the operator.

Example:

```json
{
  "cashier": {
    "id": "5",
    "name": "Anna Andersson"
  }
}
```

### sales_recording_system

_sales_recording_system_ identifies the system (POS/ECR) creating the receipt. Any of _id/name_ can be used to identify the POS.

Example:

```json
{
  "sales_recording_system": {
    "serial_number": "EA38329",
    "name": "kassa 3",
    "id": "k3"
  }
}
```

### receipt_identifier

According to the fiscal law for cash registers the receipt must have a _sequence_number_. The _sequence_number_ is a counter that is reset when it reaches a certain value making it non-unique.
The _extended_number_ can be used as a unique receipt identifier within a given _context_.
Supported contexts:

- store
- chain
- global

The _extended_number_ can be used as a receipt reference between related receipts. Example a sales and return receipt.

```json
{
  "receipt_identifier": {
    "sequence_number": 123456,
    "extended_number": {
      "value": "0123456123",
      "type": "EAN8",
      "context": "store"
    }
  }
}
```

### currency

This property gives the currency code for all amounts in the receipt. If a payment is done in a foreign currency it is defined in the tender part. The currency must be given in [ISO-4217 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

Example:

```json
{
  "currency": "SEK"
}
```

### totals

The totals sections gives totals of these types:

- _paid_: The amount the customer pays/hands over or is given in case of e.g. return of goods. The gross amount taking discount and rounding into account.
- _net_: Total including discounts, excluding vat, of all products/services bought/returned.
- _gross_: Total including vat, excluding discounts, of all products/services bought/returned.
- _vat_: The vat of all products/services bought/returned.
- _rounding_: If applicable (e.g. cash payment).
- _discount_: Total discount given customer.

Each total can have subtotals, example:

- _paid_: Example cash payment: You pay 46SEK (total/type: paid), you hand over a 50SEK bill (sub_total/type: received) and get 4SEK (sub_total/type: returned).
- _gross_: Can have sub*total/type \_eligible_for_frequent_shopper_points*
- _vat_: Different tax levels used depending on service/product bought. **Note!** _taxable_amount_ should be given including vat.
- _discount_: Discount given to loyalty customer, general discounts, etc.

All totals and subtotals have a _refund_ flag. If _refund: true_ the money goes to the customer, example return receipts. Default is _false_.

Example sales:

```json
{
  "totals": [
    {
      "type": "net",
      "amount": 39.0,
      "refund": false

      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "rounding",
      "amount": 0.0

          }
        },
        {
          "type": "returned",
          "amount": 4.0,
          "text": {
            "type": "array",
            "collection": ["Växel"]
          }

{
  "type": "return",
  "identifiers": [
    {
      "identifier_type": "pos",
      "value": "912042"
    }
  ],
  "description": "Kingston USB Flash Drive 8 GB",
  "quantity": {
    "value": 1,
    "entry_method": "scanned",

      },
      "item_links": [1, 3, 5]
    }
  ]
}
```

The first modifier gives discount (percentage), of total receipt amount.
The second modifier gives a quantity based discount on certains products bought.

- _amount_: The total amount to subtract, add or replace dependent on action.
- _percent_: If the modifier is based on percentage.

The receipts will be connected based on:

- Customer

Example: Receipt connected to main order/booking, using _order_number_:

```json
{
  "customer_order": {
    "order_number": "BLX4948Z"
  }
}
```

Example: Receipt connected to _add on service_ on existing order/booking, using _order_reference_:

```json
{
  "customer_order": {
    "order_reference": "BLX4948Z"
  }
}
```

### Control unit

If a control unit is connected to the POS, information from this unit must be added to the receipt. Example:

```json
{
  "control_unit": {
    "id": "RIHTT102710007088",
    "code": "BGXOV2QOHHILXHLPHHXRAYZEKGFNC2BD;"
  }
